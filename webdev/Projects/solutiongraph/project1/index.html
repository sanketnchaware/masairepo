                Tricology focuses on the conditions and problems related to hair and scalp and also the treatment for
                those problems. At Vtiara we have an expert tricologist and hair transplant surgeon Dr Madan Kumar B J

                light therapy for hairloss which helps in reducing hairloss and also thickens your existing hair
                follicles. For baldness we have treatments like Hair Transplantation in which hair follicles will be
                extracted from the backside of your scalp and it will be implanted in the bald area. In few cases, the
                donor area(backside of scalp) will be weak. In that case we will either extract hairs from body parts
                like beard, chest and thighs. We are also specialised in performing beard transplant, eyebrow
                transplant, moustache transplant, female hair transplant etc with advanced techniques like non-shave

                hair transplant, orif the donorvarea is weak we have an alternate option called scalp micropigmentation.
                SMP is nothing but scalp tattooing through which we create an illusion of hair follicles. This
                micropigmentation is also used for permanent makeup like eyebrow thickening, permanent lip color etc. We
                at Vtiara use imported inks from German and UK which are safe and natural. These inks last for upto 5yrs
                after which a touch-up session will be required. Contact us for one of the best clinic best clinic for
